# capitol_project
This is a digital humanities project analyzing the labor that it took to construct the Texas State Capitol. 

To do so, we have taken payroll cards from the "Capitol Building Payroll index cards, 1882 to 1888" collection, housed digitally at the [Texas Digital Archive](https://tsl.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/so_146fab20-b1be-44dd-880b-a11eee0cd206/). These cards give the names of over 5,000 people employed in the construction of the Texas State Capitol.

Using webscraping and OCR, these cards were converted into a .csv. Then, using the [NamePrism API](https://www.name-prism.com/api)*, we attempted to determine the ethnicities and nationalities of the employees in our dataset.

This project seeks to understand the demographics of the people who labored to construct this well-known state building.
